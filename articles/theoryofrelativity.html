    <meta name="description" content="In 1905, Albert Einstein determined that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, and that the speed of light in a vacuum was independent of the movement of all observers. This was the theory of special relativity. He introduced a new framework for all of physics and proposed new concepts of space and time.

Einstein then spent 10 years trying to include acceleration in the theory and published his theory of general relativity in 1915. In it, he determined that massive objects cause a distortion in space-time, which is perceived as gravity.

                    <div class="box">In 1905, Albert Einstein determined that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, and that the speed of light in a vacuum was independent of the movement of all observers. This was the theory of special relativity. He introduced
                        a new framework for all of physics and proposed new concepts of space and time. Einstein then spent 10 years trying to include acceleration in the theory and published his theory of general relativity in 1915. In it, he determined
                        that massive objects cause a distortion in space-time, which is perceived as gravity.</div>
                    <h2 style="color:#7DB2CE;">The pull of gravity</h2>
                    <p>Two objects exert an attractive force on each other known as <span style="color: #E48D73;">"gravity."</span> Isaac Newton quantified gravity between two objects when he formulated his three laws of motion. The force pulling between
                        two bodies depends on how massive each is and how far apart they are. Although the center of the Earth pushes it towards it (keeping it firmly on the ground), its center of mass falls towards the Earth. But the more massive body
                        hardly feels the pull, while with your much smaller mass you find yourself firmly rooted thanks to that same force. However, Newton's laws assume that gravity is an innate force of an object that can act at a distance.<br><br>

                        <span style="color: #E48D73;">Albert Einstein</span>, in his theory of special relativity, determined that the laws of physics are the same for all observers who do not accelerate, and showed that the speed of light within a vacuum
                        is the same, regardless of the speed at The one that The observer travels. As a result, he discovered that space and time were intertwined on a single continuum known as spacetime. Events that occur at the same time for one observer
                        can occur at different times for another.<br><br> While developing the equations for his general theory of relativity, Einstein realized that <span style="color: #E48D73;">massive objects caused a distortion in space-time</span><br><br>                        Although the instruments cannot see or measure space-time, several of the phenomena predicted by their deformation have been confirmed. It is the experimental evidence of the theory.
                    </p>
                    <h2 style="color:#7DB2CE;">The scientific revolution begins</h2>
                    <p>The principles of the theory of special relativity were published in 1905. 10 years later, on November 25, 1915, and after having shown certain previous articles on November 4, 11 and 18, 1915, Albert Einstein presented to the Academy
                        of Prussian Sciences. In Berlin, Germany, one of the most incredible scientific findings in history, a new theory of gravitation that changed our perception of the universe: the theory of general relativity. In it, Einstein proposed
                        that the <span style="color: #E48D73;">universe was an absolute whole, finite but at the same time unlimited (curved on itself), which contained matter and energy distributed in an irregular way and with four dimensions.</span>                        Einstein sparked a true scientific revolution by challenging Isaac Newton's Law of Gravity.</p>
                    <h2 style="color:#7DB2CE;">The most famous formula in the world: E = mcÂ²</h2>
                    <p>The world's most famous formula defines that the equivalence between mass (m) and energy (E) implies that the energy of a moving object increases its mass, an effect that is only noticeable at speeds close to that of light (c) . Because
                        an object would have to be infinite for an object to reach the speed of light and it would take infinite energy to reach this speed, it would demonstrate that this is impossible. Only massless waves like light can move at these
                        speeds without going against the laws of physics.
                    </p>
                    <h2 style="color:#7DB2CE;">The twins paradox</h2>
                    <span class="image left">
<img src="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaax8966/F1.large.jpg" alt="twin paradox">
</span>
                    <p>To explain his theory of special relativity, before general relativity, (in which the measurement of time is not absolute, and in the case of having two observers, the time measured between two events by both does not coincide), Einstein
                        proposed send a twin brother in space on a flight at the speed of light and leave the other twin brother on Earth. So if he was right and his theory was true, when he returned he would discover that <span style="color: #E48D73;">Earthman had aged more</span>                        than he. An experiment that reminds us of the one NASA is currently developing with twin and genetically identical astronauts Scott Kelly and Mark Kelly. Scott will spend a year on the International Space Station and his brother
                        will remain on Earth. After this time, we will obtain a good range of interesting data on the medical results of both.

                        Curiosities about Albert Einstein</h2>
                    <p>Einstein dropped out of school at age 15, after earning poor grades in history, geography, and letters. He studied physics and mathematics at the Federal Polytechnic Academy in Zurich, Switzerland. He was recognized with the
                        <span style="color: #E48D73;">Nobel Prize in Physics
                            < for his research on the photoelectric effect and his contributions to the field of theoretical physics. He played the violin (and with great mastery) from a very young age. When Adolf Hitler was appointed
                                Chancellor of Germany, Einstein renounced his German nationality.</p>

                                </h2>
                                <p>As Einstein himself humorously said:</p>
                                <blockquote>âI sometimes wonder how I came to develop the theory of relativity. The reason, I think, is that a normal adult never stops to think about problems of space and time. These are things that were thought about during childhood,
                                    but my intellectual development was delayed and as a result, I began to ask myself questions about space and time when I had already grown up. "</blockquote>
